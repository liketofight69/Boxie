# Boxie
Still a work in progress\n
#What needs to be done:
Player sprite needs to be able to touch the box without going through it.
When player sprite is touching the box sprite you should be able to press a button to grab and push the box with
the arrow keys(kinda like link in loz )
When boxes are placed on the X it triggers the next level
